# Raspberry Pi Pico MicroPython SH1106 Demo

This project is a demo of the SH1106 connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
These pins are used:

* I2C0 SDA: GP4 pin 6
* I2C0 SDA: GP5 pin 7

Use the `Makefile` to copy the Python code to the board.
A copy to `main.py` can be made in order to start the demo at power-up.

The source code is taken from the Raspberry Pi Python demos repository.

* [https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-micropython-examples.git](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-micropython-examples.git)

The example can be found in the `i2c/1106oled` map.

Prior installation of MicroPython is required.
